# Overview
This program sends an email to a recipient. You can edit the message to what you wish.

How to use:
"In SendEmail.java", enter recipient and sender email as well as (your) host ip.
Edit the message to say what you wish to say. 
Run "SendEmail.java"
If all is well, the recipient will recieve an email from the sender.

I wrote this program because I want to see ways that Java can be used for sending data across servers. An email is a solid way to find out it's functionality with this transmitting process.

# Development Environment

This program was written in Eclipse. The classpath was built in Eclipse as well.

Java is used for all of this program. JavaMail API is used as a server to connect to for emailing. Java Activation Framework (JAF) is used so that the script can have online functionality.
